- **one-to-one** → Example of a one-to-one entity relationship using JPA/Hibernate.

- **one-to-many-bi-directional** → Demonstrates a bi-directional one-to-many relationship.

- **one-to-many-bi-directional-uni** → Shows uni-directional vs. bi-directional one-to-many relationships.

- **many-to-many** → Example of many-to-many mapping between entities.

- **noteapp** → A small CRUD application built with Spring Boot, demonstrating practical usage of Spring Data JPA.
